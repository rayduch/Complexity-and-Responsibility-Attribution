                    In this Module you make ten choices, but only one of them will be used in the end to determine
                    your earnings in this module. Each decision is a paired choice between "Option A" and "Option
                    B." After you have made all of your choices, the server will select at random one of the ten
                    decisions to be used, and a second random selection will determine what your payoff is for the
                    option you chose, A or B, for the particular decision selected. Even though you will make ten
                    decisions, only one of these will end up affecting your earnings, but you will not know in advance
                    which decision will be used. Obviously, each decision has an equal chance of being used in the
                    end.",

                    The sort of decisions you are going to make are the following: Decision 1, Option A pays USD 1.00
                    with probability of 10%, and it pays USD 0.80 with probability 90%. Option B pays USD 1.97 with
                    probability of 10%, and it pays USD 0.05 with probability of 90%. The other Decisions are similar,
                    except the chances of the higher payoff for each option increase. In fact, for Decision 10, the
                    second selection will not be needed since each option pays the highest payoff for sure, so your
                    choice here is between USD 1.00 and USD 1.97.",
